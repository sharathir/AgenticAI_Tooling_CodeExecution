📊 Risk Analysis Summary:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
**Risk Assessment Report**

**Application ID:** APP-1003
**Applicant Name:** Bruce Banner
**Requesting Coverage:** $5,000,000

**I. Risk Classification Evaluation**

The applicant's risk classification is HIGH_RISK, which requires a detailed review of their risk factors. The requested coverage amount of $5,000,000 exceeds the threshold for DECLINE under our underwriting policies.        

**II. Policy Considerations**

1. **Coverage Amount Flags:**
        * Coverage exceeding $3M requires executive underwriting approval.
        * HIGH_RISK applicants requesting >$3M coverage face a strong presumption of DECLINESS.
2. **High Coverage Amount Flag:** The requested coverage amount ($5,000,000) triggers the high coverage amount flag, which necessitates executive underwriting approval.

**III. Evaluation of Compensating Factors**

Despite the high risk level and excessive coverage amount, Bruce Banner presents a unique set of mitigating factors:
* Medical records: Available upon request.
* Financial statements: Available upon request.

However, no compelling compensating factors are evident to justify conditional approval or mitigation of risks. 

**IV. Preliminary Recommendation (Approve, Conditional, Decline)**

Based on the analysis:

1. **Exceeds Coverage Threshold:** The coverage amount exceeds the $3M threshold for DECLINE under our HIGH_RISK policy.
2. **Preliminary Risk Assessment:** Given Bruce Banner's risk factors and the high exposure under the requested coverage amount, there is a strong persuasion towards DECLINESS.

**Recommendation:** Due to the unprecedented high coverage amount of $5,000,000, I recommend APPROVAL with EXECUTIVE APPROVAL for review by our Senior Underwriter. The senior underwriter must assess whether Bruce Banner's risks justify such extensive coverage.

Please note that this report provides an objective analysis based on available information and should be verified upon further evaluation by the executive underwriting committee.

- Coverage > $3M typically requires DECLINE for HIGH_RISK applicants
- Coverage $2M-$3M may be conditionally approved with 50-75% premium surcharge
- Coverage < $2M may be approved with 25-50% surcharge and exclusions

DECISION GUIDELINES:
1. Evaluate if coverage amount exceeds acceptable threshold for HIGH_RISK
2. Consider if compensating factors could justify conditional approval

HIGH COVERAGE AMOUNT FLAGS:
- Coverage exceeding $3M requires executive underwriting approval
- HIGH_RISK applicants requesting >$3M coverage face strong presumption of DECLINE
- Enhanced due diligence mandatory for all >$3M applications


FULL POLICY REFERENCE:

UNDERWRITING POLICY GUIDELINES FOR INSURANCE COVERAGE:

1. RISK STATUS ASSESSMENT:
   - LOW_RISK: Standard approval, minimal restrictions
   - MEDIUM_RISK: Conditional approval with enhanced monitoring or premium adjustments
   - HIGH_RISK: Requires detailed review, often DECLINED unless compensating factors present

2. COVERAGE AMOUNT THRESHOLDS:
   - Up to $2M: Standard underwriting process
   - $2M - $4M: Enhanced review required, additional medical/financial documentation
   - Above $4M: Executive underwriting, extensive due diligence mandatory

📊 Risk Analysis Summary:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
**Risk Assessment Report**

**Application ID:** APP-1006

**Applicant Information:**

* Name: Hal Jordan
* Risk Classification: HIGH_RISK
* Requested Coverage: $4,000,000

**Policy Reference:**

* **Coverage Amount Thresholds:**
        + Up to $2M: Standard underwriting process
        + $2M - $4M: Enhanced review required, additional medical/financial documentation
        + Above $4M: Executive underwriting, extensive due diligence mandatory
* **High Risk Evaluation Criteria:**
        + Coverage > $3M typically requires DECLINE for HIGH_RISK applicants

**Risk Assessment:**

1. **Whether the coverage amount is appropriate for this risk level:** YES (However, coverage exceeds the $3M threshold)
2. **Key Policy Considerations:**
        * The requested coverage of $4,000,000 falls above the $4M threshold, triggering executive underwriting.
        * As a HIGH_RISK applicant, Hal Jordan's request is subject to strong presumption of DECLINE unless compensating factors are present.

**Preliminary Recommendation:** DECLINE (with possibility of Conditional Approval with Senior Underwriter)      

**Rationale:**
Hal Jordan's requested coverage amount exceeds the $3M threshold, which typically requires DECLINE for HIGH_RISK applicants. The application does not provide sufficient mitigating factors to justify conditional approval.    

**Conditions and Potential Adjustments:**

* Enhanced due diligence is mandatory for all >$3M applications.
* If Hal Jordan can provide significant compensating factors (e.g., improved credit score, stable employment history), the application might be considered for Conditional Approval with Senior Underwriter.

**Recommendations:**

1. Refer to senior underwriter for additional review and consideration of compensating factors.
2. Emphasize the need for comprehensive evaluation, including lifestyle assessment, medical exams, and financial audit, to justify executive underwriting approval.
3. Assess Hal Jordan's risk profile further, considering his age, occupation, and other actuarial risk factors. 

**Next Steps:**

* Schedule a meeting with senior underwriter to discuss the application and potential compensating factors.     
* Obtain comprehensive evaluation reports from relevant parties (e.g., medical providers, financial institutions) to present to the senior underwriter.
* Reassess Hal Jordan's risk profile using updated data and additional information.
